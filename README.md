### Introduction

This repository contains my work for the course project for "Getting and Cleaning Data" on Coursera.

The purpose of this project is to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis

### Run the script

1. Please get the compressed file from this link (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)
2. Please extract the compressed file into a folder named "UCI HAR Dataset"
3. Execute run_analysis.R, this script will clean and merge data from "UCI HAR Dataset" and generate a tidy data file "tidy_data.txt" and another tidy data file "detail.txt"  with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

I have put both tidy_data.txt and detail.txt in this repository.

### CodeBook

CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data.
